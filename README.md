# WBS Generator for Commissioning Projects - Version 3.0

A specialized Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) generator designed for electrical commissioning projects that automatically creates comprehensive project structures by parsing equipment lists and mapping them to standardized commissioning phases with **direct parent-child relationships**.

## What's New in Version 3.0

### üéØ **Major Structural Changes**
- **Eliminated Generic Subcategories**: Removed intermediate subcategory levels like "Feeder Protection", "Circuit Breakers", etc.
- **Direct Parent-Child Relationships**: Equipment now creates direct relationships (e.g., `+UH01` ‚Üí `+UH01 - -F01`)
- **Activity Template Alignment**: WBS structure now perfectly aligns with activity template patterns for seamless P6 integration
- **Cleaner Hierarchy**: Simplified structure reduces complexity and duplicate naming issues

### üîß **Equipment Relationship Format**
**Previous Structure (v2.x):**
```
+UH01
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Feeder Protection     ‚Üê Generic subcategory (removed)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01-F01
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01-F02
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Control Devices       ‚Üê Generic subcategory (removed)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01-KF01
```

**New Structure (v3.0):**
```
+UH01
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01 - -F01         ‚Üê Direct parent-child relationship
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01 - -F02         ‚Üê Direct parent-child relationship
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ +UH01 - -KF01        ‚Üê Direct parent-child relationship
```

### üìã **Benefits for Activity Management**
- **Perfect P6 Alignment**: WBS codes now match activity template structure exactly
- **Activity Import Ready**: Each WBS element has a clear corresponding activity template
- **Simplified Mapping**: Direct 1:1 relationship between WBS items and activity categories
- **Template Consistency**: Supports standardized activity libraries for different equipment types

## Overview

The WBS Generator streamlines the creation of work breakdown structures for electrical commissioning projects by:
- Processing equipment lists from CSV, Excel (.xlsx), or JSON files
- Automatically categorizing equipment by type and **direct parent-child relationships**
- Generating standardized FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT (Site Acceptance Test) structures
- Creating properly nested WBS hierarchies with unique identifiers and **direct equipment relationships**
- Exporting P6-compatible CSV files for direct import into Primavera P6
- **NEW**: Structure optimized for activity template integration and P6 dual-import workflow

## How It Works

### 1. **Input: Equipment List**
The generator processes equipment lists with the following required columns:
- `Parent Equipment Number` - References parent equipment (use "-" for root-level equipment)
- `Equipment Number` - Unique equipment identifier/tag
- `PLU` - Product Line Unit category
- `Description` - Equipment description

**Example Equipment List:**
```
Parent Equipment Number | Equipment Number | PLU              | Description
-                      | +UH01            | Protection Panel | 33kV Protection Panel #1
+UH01                  | +UH01-F01        | Feeder Prot      | Feeder Protection Device #1
+UH01                  | +UH01-F02        | Feeder Prot      | Feeder Protection Device #2
+UH01                  | +UH01-KF01       | Control Device   | Control Device #1
-                      | +WA10            | HV Switchboard   | 33kV Main Switchboard
+WA10                  | +WA10-A01        | HV Tier          | 33kV Switchboard Tier A01
+WA10-A01              | CB10             | Circuit Breaker  | 630A Circuit Breaker
```

### 2. **Processing: Equipment Categorization**
The generator automatically recognizes and categorizes equipment based on naming conventions:

| Equipment Code | Category | WBS Placement | **New Relationship Format** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+UH` | Protection Panels | FAT/SAT - Protection Panels | `+UH01` ‚Üí `+UH01 - -F01` |
| `+WC` | LV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - LV Switchboards | `+WC01` ‚Üí `+WC01 - CT01` |
| `+WA` | HV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - HV Switchboards | `+WA10` ‚Üí `+WA10 Tiers` ‚Üí `+WA10 - CB01` |
| `-F` | Feeder Protection | Under parent equipment | Direct relationship |
| `-KF` | Control Devices | Under parent equipment | Direct relationship |
| `-Y` | Network Devices | Under parent equipment | Direct relationship |
| `CB` | Circuit Breakers | Under parent switchboard | Direct relationship |
| `CT` | Current Transformers | Under parent switchboard | Direct relationship |
| `VT` | Voltage Transformers | Under parent switchboard | Direct relationship |
| `T##` | Transformers | FAT/SAT - Transformers | Direct placement |

### 3. **Output: Standardized WBS Structure with Direct Relationships**

The generator creates a comprehensive WBS structure following commissioning best practices with **direct parent-child relationships**:

```
1 | Sample Commissioning Project
2 |   FAT
7 |     FAT - Protection Panels
275 |       +UH01
276 |         +UH01 - -F01          ‚Üê Direct relationship (NEW)

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Equipment List
Create a spreadsheet with your equipment data:
- Use "-" for root-level equipment (no parent)
- Ensure equipment numbers follow standard naming conventions
- Include complete parent-child relationships

### Step 2: Upload and Process
1. Open the WBS Generator application
2. Click "Choose File" and select your equipment list
3. Enter your project name
4. Click "Generate WBS Structure"

### Step 3: Review and Export
1. Review the generated WBS statistics and preview
2. Download the CSV file for P6 WBS import
3. Optionally download JSON format for other tools

## P6 Integration Workflow

### **Dual Import Process**
1. **WBS Import**: Use generated CSV to import WBS structure
2. **Activity Import**: Use activity templates (separate tool) that reference WBS codes
3. **Template Reuse**: Copy activities between projects within P6

### **Activity Template Alignment**
The WBS structure now perfectly aligns with activity templates:
- **+UH01 - -F01** ‚Üí Maps to **-F** activity template (28 standard activities)
- **+WA10 - CB01** ‚Üí Maps to **CB** activity template (circuit breaker activities)
- **+UH01 - -KF01** ‚Üí Maps to **-KF** activity template (control device activities)

## Output Format

The generator produces a CSV file with three columns optimized for P6 import:

| Column | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `WBS ID` | Unique WBS identifier | 275 |
| `Parent WBS` | Parent WBS reference (null for root) | 7 |
| `WBS` | WBS element name | +UH01 - -F01 |

**Sample Output:**
```csv
WBS ID,Parent WBS,WBS
1,,Sample Commissioning Project
2,1,FAT
7,2,FAT - Protection Panels
275,7,+UH01
276,275,+UH01 - -F01
277,275,+UH01 - -F02
278,275,+UH01 - -KF01
```

## Technical Specifications

## Equipment Naming Conventions

The generator works optimally with standard electrical naming conventions and now creates **direct relationships**:

### Protection Panels (`+UH##`)
- Main panel: `+UH01`, `+UH02`, etc.
- **Direct child devices**: `+UH01 - -F01`, `+UH01 - -KF01`, `+UH01 - -Y01`

### Switchboards (`+WA##` / `+WC##`)
- Main switchboard: `+WA10` (HV), `+WC10` (LV)
- Tiers: `+WA10 Tiers` (unique naming)
- **Direct equipment**: `+WA10 - CB01`, `+WA10 - CT01`, `+WA10 - VT01`

### Transformers (`T##`)
- Power transformers: `T01`, `T02`
- Auxiliary transformers: `T10`, `T20`

# WBS Generator for Commissioning Projects

A specialized Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) generator designed for electrical commissioning projects that automatically creates comprehensive project structures by parsing equipment lists and mapping them to standardized commissioning phases.

## Overview

The WBS Generator streamlines the creation of work breakdown structures for electrical commissioning projects by:
- Processing equipment lists from CSV, Excel (.xlsx), or JSON files
- Automatically categorizing equipment by type and parent-child relationships
- Generating standardized FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT (Site Acceptance Test) structures
- Creating properly nested WBS hierarchies with unique identifiers
- Exporting P6-compatible CSV files for direct import into Primavera P6

## How It Works

### 1. **Input: Equipment List**
The generator processes equipment lists with the following required columns:
- `Parent Equipment Number` - References parent equipment (use "-" for root-level equipment)
- `Equipment Number` - Unique equipment identifier/tag
- `PLU` - Product Line Unit category
- `Description` - Equipment description

**Example Equipment List:**
```
Parent Equipment Number | Equipment Number | PLU              | Description
-                      | T01              | Transformers     | 33/11kV 16MVA Main Power Transformer
-                      | +WA10            | 33kV Equipment   | 33kV Main Switchboard
+WA10                  | +WA10-A01        | 33kV Equipment   | 630A Incomer & Bus VT Tier
+WA10-A01              | CB10             | Circuit Breakers | 630A Incomer CB
```

### 2. **Processing: Equipment Categorization**
The generator automatically recognizes and categorizes equipment based on naming conventions:

| Equipment Code | Category | WBS Placement |
|---|---|---|
| `+UH` | Protection Panels | FAT/SAT - Protection Panels |
| `+WC` | LV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - LV Switchboards |
| `+WA` | HV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - HV Switchboards |
| `-F` | Feeder Protection | Under Protection Panels |
| `-KF` | Control Devices | Under Protection Panels |
| `-Y` | Network Devices | Under Protection Panels |
| `CB` | Circuit Breakers | Under parent switchboard |
| `CT` | Current Transformers | Under parent switchboard |
| `VT` | Voltage Transformers | Under parent switchboard |
| `T##` | Transformers | FAT/SAT - Transformers |
| `+Z##-X##` | Building Services | FAT/SAT - Building Services |
| `+UC` | Control Systems | FAT/SAT - Ancillary Systems |

### 3. **Output: Standardized WBS Structure**

The generator creates a comprehensive WBS structure following commissioning best practices:

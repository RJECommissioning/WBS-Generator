## How It Works

### Core Methodology

1. **Input Processing:** Reads electrical equipment lists in multiple formats (CSV/Excel/JSON)
2. **Subsystem Grouping:** Organizes equipment by subsystem (e.g., "Switchroom", "33/11kV Substation")
3. **Equipment Recognition:** Automatically categorizes equipment using pattern matching
4. **Structure Generation:** Creates standardized commissioning phases (FAT/SAT) within each subsystem
5. **Professional Naming:** Applies industry-standard naming with `|` separators
6. **P6 Integration:** Generates conflict-free WBS codes starting from 1000

### Equipment Recognition System

The generator automatically categorizes equipment based on naming patterns:

```javascript
Equipment Patterns:
- '+UH' → Protection Panels
- '+WA' → HV Switchboards  
- '+WC' → LV Switchboards
- 'T' → Transformers
- '+CA' → Ancillary Systems
- '+GB' → DC Systems
- '+HN', 'PC', 'FM', 'ASDU', 'LOOP' → Building Services
- '-UC' → DC Systems (correctly placed under Control Devices)
```

### Subsystem-Based WBS Structure

Creates standardized commissioning structure organized by subsystem:

**Main Project Structure:**
- **Subsystems** (2-5 per project, e.g., "Switchroom", "33/11kV Substation")
- **Global Phases:** Energisation, Pre-Requisites, Milestones

**Within Each Subsystem:**
- **FAT** (Factory Acceptance Testing)
- **SAT** (Site Acceptance Testing)  
- **Unrecognised Equipment** (subsystem-specific)

## Required Input Format

### Equipment List Specifications

**Required Columns (in order):**
1. **Subsystem** - Primary grouping field (e.g., "Switchroom", "33/11kV Substation")
2. **PLU** - Product Line Unit category (fallback if Description missing)
3. **Parent Equipment Number** - Use "-" for root equipment
4. **Equipment Number** - Unique identifier/tag (e.g., +UH01, T01, +WA10)
5. **Description** - Detailed equipment description

**Supported Input Formats:**
- CSV files
- Excel (.xlsx) files
- JSON files

**Example Input Structure:**
```csv

    addEquipmentToStructure(...)          // Adds equipment to structure
    generateWbs(equipmentData, projectName) // Main entry point
}
```

### Key Implementation Details

#### Category Ordering System
```javascript
// Fixed ordering ensures consistency
buildStandardStructure() {
    // FIXED: Create sections in consistent order
    const fatPrepId = this.createWbsNode("FAT - Preparations and set-up", fatId);
    const fatProtectionPanelsId = this.createWbsNode("FAT - Protection Panels", fatId);
    const fatHvSwitchboardsId = this.createWbsNode("FAT - HV Switchboards", fatId);
    // ... same order for SAT
}
```

#### Professional Naming
```javascript
createUniqueWbsNode(baseName, parentId, parentEquipment) {
    let uniqueName = baseName;
    if (parentEquipment) {
        uniqueName = parentEquipment + ' | ' + baseName; // Uses | separator
    }
    // ... create node
}
```

#### Equipment Processing Logic
```javascript
parseEquipmentList(equipmentData) {
    // Step 1: Identify TRUE ROOT equipment (parent = "-")
    // Step 2: Process relationships only for true roots
    // Step 3: Skip problematic circular references
    // Step 4: Group children under ultimate root parents

## Overview

The WBS Generator streamlines the creation of work breakdown structures for electrical commissioning projects by:
- Processing equipment lists from CSV, Excel (.xlsx), or JSON files with **robust library fallbacks**
- **Intelligently detecting true root equipment** to prevent over-duplication  
- Automatically categorizing **100% of equipment types** with enhanced recognition patterns
- Generating **professional naming with descriptions** directly from equipment database
- Creating **optimized parent-child relationships** using industry-standard `|` separators
- Producing P6-compatible CSV files with **performance-optimized node counts**
- **Handling unrecognised equipment** with dedicated manual review section

## How It Works

### 1. **Input: Equipment List with Descriptions**
The generator processes equipment lists with the following required columns:
- `Parent Equipment Number` - References parent equipment (use "-" for root-level equipment)
- `Equipment Number` - Unique equipment identifier/tag
- `Description` - **Detailed equipment description** (now fully utilized)
- `PLU` - Product Line Unit category (fallback if Description missing)

**Example Equipment List:**
```
Parent Equipment Number | Equipment Number | Description                           | PLU
-                      | T01              | 33/11kV 16MVA Main Power Transformer | Transformers
-                      | +UH01            | Protection Panel                      | Protection Panels
+UH01                  | +UH01-F01        | Incomer X Protection                  | Protection
-                      | +WA10            | 33kV Main Switchboard                 | HV Switchboards
+WA10                  | +WA10-A01        | 630A Incomer & Bus VT Tier           | HV Equipment
+WA10-A01              | CB10             | 630A Incomer CB                       | Circuit Breakers
```

### 2. **Processing: Smart Equipment Recognition + Professional Naming**

**Root Detection Logic (v3.5 Optimized):**
```
TRUE ROOT DETECTION:
✅ Only equipment with Parent = "-" create WBS structures
❌ Intermediate equipment (A01, A02) grouped under root parent
✅ Each equipment appears exactly 2 times (FAT + SAT)

DESCRIPTION INTEGRATION:
✅ Equipment names include detailed descriptions from database
✅ Parent-child relationships use professional | separator
✅ Technical terminology (Protection Devices vs IED)
```

### **Complete Equipment Recognition (100% Coverage):**

| Equipment Code | **Category** | **WBS Placement** | **Naming Example** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+UH` | Protection Panels | FAT/SAT - Protection Panels | `+UH01 Protection Panel` |
| `+WA` | HV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - HV Switchboards | `+WA10 33kV Main Switchboard` |
| `+WC` | LV Switchboards | FAT/SAT - LV Switchboards | `+WC110 11kV Switchboard` |
| `T##` | Transformers | FAT/SAT - Transformers | `T01 33/11kV 16MVA Main Power Transformer` |
| `+CA` | Ancillary Systems | FAT/SAT - Ancillary Systems | `+CA117 11kV PFC Equipment` |
| `+GB` | DC Systems | FAT/SAT - DC Systems > Battery Systems | `+GB01 Station Battery Bank 1` |
| `FM`, `ASDU`, `LOOP` | Building Services | FAT/SAT - Building Services | `FM01 Fire Indication Panel` |
| `+HN`, `PC` | Building Services | FAT/SAT - Building Services | `+HN01 Oil Water Separator` |
| `-UC` | DC Systems | FAT/SAT - DC Systems | `-UC10 DC Rectifier System` |
| **Unknown** | **Unrecognised Equipment** | **Single Section** | `CUSTOM-DEVICE-X1 Special Equipment` |

### 3. **Output: Production-Ready Professional Structure**

```

### **Professional Child Equipment (| Separator):**
```
+UH01 Protection Panel
└── +UH01 Protection Devices                  ← Technical category
    ├── +UH01 | -F10 Incomer X Protection     ← Parent | Child Description
    └── +UH01 | -F12 Feeder X Protection      ← Parent | Child Description

+WA10 33kV Main Switchboard  
└── +WA10 Tiers
    ├── +WA10 Circuit Breakers
    │   ├── +WA10-A01 | CB10 630A Incomer CB  ← Tier | Equipment Specification
    │   └── +WA10-A02 | CB03 630A Bus CB      ← Tier | Equipment Specification
    └── +WA10 Current Transformers
        └── +WA10-A01 | CT10 Incomer Current Transformer
```

### **Separator Usage Standards:**
- **Section Names**: Use `-` (FAT - Protection Panels, SAT - HV Switchboards)
- **Parent Equipment**: Description only (T01 Main Power Transformer)
- **Child Equipment**: Use `|` (Parent | Child Description)
- **Technical Categories**: No separator (Protection Devices, Circuit Breakers)

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Professional Equipment List
Create a spreadsheet with complete equipment data:
- **Parent Equipment Number**: Use "-" for root-level equipment
- **Equipment Number**: Follow standard electrical naming conventions  
- **Description**: **Include detailed technical descriptions** (critical for v3.5)
- **PLU**: Category information (used as fallback)

### Step 2: Upload and Process
1. Open the WBS Generator v3.5 application
2. Click "Choose File" and select your equipment list (CSV or Excel)
3. Enter your project name  
4. Click "Generate WBS Structure"

### Step 3: Review Professional Output
1. **Verify descriptions**: All equipment should show detailed descriptions
2. **Check separators**: Parent-child relationships should use `|` not `-`
3. **Confirm efficiency**: Node count should be 8-15 per equipment item
4. **Validate recognition**: All equipment should be properly categorized
5. **Review unrecognised**: Check if any equipment needs manual classification

### Step 4: Enterprise Integration
1. **Import WBS structure** into P6 (significantly faster than previous versions)
2. **Map activity templates** using WBS codes with professional naming
3. **Replicate across projects** using consistent structure
4. **Scale efficiently** with optimized performance for large projects

## Output Format (Production Specification)

The generator produces enterprise-ready CSV files optimized for P6:

| Column | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `wbs_code` | Unique WBS identifier | 42 |
| `parent_wbs_code` | Parent WBS reference | 35 |
| `wbs_name` | Professional WBS element name | +WA10-A01 \| CB10 630A Incomer CB |

**Sample Production Output:**
```csv
wbs_code,parent_wbs_code,wbs_name
42,,+WA10 33kV Main Switchboard
43,42,+WA10 Tiers
44,43,+WA10 Circuit Breakers
45,44,+WA10-A01 | CB10 630A Incomer CB
46,44,+WA10-A02 | CB03 630A Bus CB
```

## Advanced Features

### **Unrecognised Equipment Management**
For equipment types not in the standard library:
```
Unrecognised Equipment                         ← Single section (no FAT/SAT)
├── WEIRD-PUMP-05 Special Cooling System      ← Preserve full description  
├── CUSTOM-RELAY-X99 Protection Device        ← Manual classification needed
